-- | This module provides the Drawing functionality for the
-- ChannelList sidebar.  The sidebar is divided vertically into groups
-- and each group is rendered separately.
--
-- There are actually two UI modes handled by this code:
--
--   * Normal display of the channels, with various markers to
--     indicate the current channel, channels with unread messages,
--     user state (for Direct Message channels), etc.
--
--   * ChannelSelect display where the user is typing match characters
--     into a prompt at the ChannelList sidebar is showing only those
--     channels matching the entered text (and highlighting the
--     matching portion).

-- | Specify the different groups of channels to be displayed
-- vertically in the ChannelList sidebar.  This list provides the
-- central control over what channels are displayed and how they are
-- grouped.
--
-- Each group is specified as a tuple of:
--
--   * the name of this group
--
--   * A lens to get the HashMap of matching selections when in
--     ChannelSelect mode (ignored for Normal mode).
--
--   * The function to retrieve the list of channels for this group
--     from the ChatState.
--
-- The retrieval function is also given an optional integer that
-- indicates the height of the channel list (the amount of screen space
-- available to be used). This is provided as an optimization so that we
-- can avoid rendering all known entries when they wouldn't be visible
-- anyway. Please see 'getDmChannels' for more details.
--
-- The height value is optional because when we're in channel selection
-- mode, we don't want to optimize away hidden channel list entries. If
-- we were to do that, they wouldn't be checked for matching against the
-- channel selection input. So in that case 'Nothing' is given as the
-- channel list height. But otherwise when we're not in that mode we
-- want to skip rendering hidden entries. (Ideally we wouldn't need this
-- hack at all and could be smart about which entries to show regardless
-- of mode, but right now we use a Brick viewport to make scrolling the
-- channel list easy, but that doesn't give us much control over which
-- entries to skip.)
--
-- Lastly, this functionality uses Sequences instead of lists to
-- facilitate efficient take/drop operations when the optimization
-- mentioned above is in effect.

-- entries that won't be visible on the screen anyway, and that turns

-- matter where the selected channel is within the set of returned
-- entries, there are enough entries before and after the selected
-- channel to get the Brick viewport to position the final result in a
-- way that is natural.
